# Iris Species Classification with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for classifying iris species using the famous Iris dataset. The implementation includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training with Random Forest, and comparison with other algorithms (SVM and Logistic Regression).

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features each:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm) 
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

**Target classes (3 species):**
- Setosa (0)
- Versicolor (1) 
- Virginica (2)

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Exploration**: Load and visualize the dataset structure
- **Preprocessing**: Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- **Model Training**: Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis of which features contribute most to predictions
- **Model Comparison**: Performance comparison with SVM and Logistic Regression
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrix heatmap and feature importance bar plot
